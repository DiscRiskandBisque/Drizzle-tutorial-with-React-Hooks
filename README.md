# Drizzle tutorial with React Hooks

![drizzle_logo](https://github.com/trufflesuite/drizzle/raw/master/readme/drizzle-logomark.png?raw=true)

I created a **React Hooks** version of this [**Drizzle tutorial**](https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-drizzle-and-react). 

See the ReactJS [guidance on using hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) and [Drizzle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/drizzle) for further details.

##To run##

In the main project directory:

```
truffle develop
```

Then, in truffle's developer console: 
```
compile
```

and then:
```
migrate
```

Now that you have successfully launched your Solidity contract onto your local blockchain, go into the client directory:

```
cd client
```

Run the project on by entering the following:

```
npm start
```

To see your project in the browser, go to http://localhost:3000/
